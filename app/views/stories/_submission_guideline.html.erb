<ul id="guideline" class="ph3 lh-copy" style="display: none;">
  <li>
    Do not editorialize story titles, but when
    the original story's title has no context or is unclear,
    please change it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Please remove extraneous components from
    titles such as the name of the site, blog,
    section, and author.
  </li>
  <li>
    When the story being submitted is more than
    a year or so old, please add the year the
    story was written to the post title in
    parentheses.
  </li>
  <li>
    If no <a href="/tags">tags</a> clearly apply
    to the story you are submitting, chances
    are the tag is not added yet, feel
    free to propose new tag via new story
    tagged as <span class="code">meta</span>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Do not overreach with tags if they are not
    the primary focus of the story.
  </li>
  <li>
    When submitting a URL, the text field is
    optional and should only be used when
    additional context or explanation of the URL is
    needed.
  </li>
  <li>
  Commentary or opinion should be reserved for a comment,
  so that it can be voted on separately from the story.
  </li>
  <li>
    To be able to easily submit a page you're
    viewing in your browser to
    <span class="code b">0xblockchain</span>,
    drag this bookmarklet to your
    bookmark bar:
    [<a href="javascript:{window.open(%22<%= Rails.application.root_url
    %>stories/new?url=%22+encodeURIComponent(document.location)+<%
    %>%22&title=%22+encodeURIComponent(document.title));%20void(0);}<%
    %>">Submit to 0xblockchain</a>].
    You'll be taken to this page with
    the viewed page's URL and title.
  </li>
</ul>
